# Projeto-Mario

I participated in an event organized by the DevEmDobro twins, where we developed the Mario project together, writing the code from scratch to the end.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive viewer
- Implementation with javascript

### What I learned

I want to highlight this part of the code, as this was one of the most important skills this project gave me. Learn to toggle the modal in an easy and clean way to read.

```javascript
function alternarModal () {
    modal.classList.toggle("aberto");
}

botaoTrailer.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alternarModal();
    video.setAttribute("src", linkDoVideo);
});
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about the features that javascript can bring to my projects and implement it more and more.
